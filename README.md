# Artificial-Neural-Network-Churn
An analysis to predict customer churn in a bank is conducted using one of the deep learning techniques called artificial neural network. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a business's products and services within a certain period of time. In a bank, having more customers leads to higher profits. In this dataset, various features are included to evaluate why a customer stops using the bank's services. The results of this research will be able to predict for new customer data which ones are likely to have a high probability of discontinuing their banking usage. Therefore, the bank can offer special incentives to customers who have a high likelihood of churning.
